# Assembly-and-Architecture-MASM-x86
String Primitives and Macros

This project was a culmination of smaller projects to understand how Assembly is implemented in MASM x86 using the Irvine Library. User will input then convert it to strings, and then convert it back to integers. 

All procedures are passed to the runtime stack, Strings are passed by reference. Registers are saved and restored in accordance to procedures and macros. 

The purpose of this projected was to explore the low level part of modern languaged without all the abstraction, the experience helped to developer a deeper appreciation for modern programming languages.
